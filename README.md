## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model ($k=5$) to accurately classify breast tumors as Malignant (M) or Benign (B) based on diagnostic measurements.

## Dataset Link
- [Kaggle: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `kaggle`

## Methodology
1. **Data Understanding**: Identified numerical features and target variable (`diagnosis`), inspecting data types and distributions.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Dropped unnecessary columns (`id` and `Unnamed: 32`).
   - Encoded target variable `diagnosis` (`M`: 1, `B`: 0).
   - Split dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets using stratified sampling.
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler` to equalize feature contributions across distance metrics.
3. **Model Development**: Trained a `KNeighborsClassifier` with $k=5$ on the scaled training features.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and a Confusion Matrix heatmap.

## Results
- **Accuracy:** 95.61%
- **Precision:** 97.44%
- **Recall:** 90.48%
- **F1-Score:** 0.9383

## Conclusion
The KNN model ($k=5$) successfully classifies tumor samples with 95.61% accuracy. Feature scaling with `StandardScaler` is essential to prevent distance dominance by large-magnitude features. While highly effective for small diagnostic datasets, KNN's primary limitation is its high memory footprint and query latency when scaling to larger datasets.
